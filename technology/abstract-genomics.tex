With the size of medical data getting increased exponentially from 
petabytes to exabytes rapidly, Google came up with Google Genomics 
as extension to Google cloud platform.It helps the life science 
community organize the information about genomics and also make it 
available~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-genomics}. 
Researchers are able to apply Google powerful technologies such as 
Google Search and Maps to securely store, process, explore, and share 
large, complex genomics datasets~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-genomics}.
Multiple genome repositories data can be processed using Google 
Genomics within seconds as it is backed by Google bigtable and 
Spanner technologies~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-genomics}. 
``It is based on open standard from Global Alliance of Genomics and 
Health achieving higher level of interoperability for genomics 
data``~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-genomics}. It is fully integrated with 
Google cloud virtual machine, storage and SQL/NoSQL 
databases~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-genomics}.It helps analysing Genomic 
data in real-time with BigQuery. Pragrammers can analyze world
wide genomics data using their prefered language with Cloud Datalab in 
transaction mode or in batch mode using GATK on Google Genomics. For faster
processing and analyzing such large data sets Apache spark or grid cluster
may be used~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-genomics}.
