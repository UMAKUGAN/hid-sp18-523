Google Cloud Vision API has made the herculean task of correct 
labeling/classification of images simple. With exponential increase 
in different types of data including images, voice, video are 
transformed into digital form, stored and transmitted over network. 
There was a dire need of automated technology solution that can 
correctly classify / label images with high level of confidence; 
Google Vision API provides such platform to researchers and developers. 
It quickly classify images into thousands of predefined 
meaningful categories~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision}. 
It does this by encapsulating powerful machine learning 
models (KNN, Regression) etc for classification of images. 
It help detects objects and faces within images, finds and reads 
printed words contained within images through 
Optical Character Recognition i,e OCR~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision}. 
Developers can build meta data on their image catalog, they can tag the
rating of the content and define the category such as adult content, 
offensive content etc. Using the API customized marketing campaign may be
launched through image sentiment analysis. It can be accessed 
through REST API~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision}.
