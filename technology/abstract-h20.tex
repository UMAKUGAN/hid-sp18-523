\index{H2o}


H20 is a open source platform that can execute highly advanced and complex machine learning algorithms in faster and scalable way, regardless of the size, format and location of the data\cite{www-h2o}.
It achieves this by serializing the data faster between nodes and clusters that stores huge amount of data. Data processing is done in memory thus providing faster response\cite{www-h2o}.
It uses fine grain parallelism technique for processing of distributed data archiving 100x faster speed as compared to traditional mapreduce without compromising on accuracy \cite{www-h2o}.
