With vast amount of publicly available data over the internet / cloud , there was a need of technological system/framework 
that is deployed on cloud which can execute on demand queries in faster and scalable way for read only multi level nested 
data. Along with that a system that uses structured query language, which is widely adapted and extensively used by the 
developers for writing queries to avoid the learning curve of new language. To fill this gap Google came up with Dremel. 
It is a interactive ad hoc query system that lets the user query the large dataset providing them results with much faster 
speed compared to traditional technologies\cite{www-dremel}. "By combining multi-level execution trees and columnar data layout, 
it is capable of running aggregation queries over trillion-row tables in seconds"\cite{www-dremel}. "Dremel is capable of 
scaling up to thousands of CPUs and petabytes of data"\cite{www-dremel}.
